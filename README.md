A Mastodon instance can go down, and can die. This happens.

That's why users should always have essential information backuped on their own computer, most essentially their list of following and of followers.

With those lists, they can start a new account if necessary, even if their old one is unreachable, and follow again the same users, and notify people who were following them of their new account.
